# Disable the GNU parallel citation boilerplate.
# Yes, we all will cite a GNU parallel paper if we really base
# our to be published work on GNU parallel.
# This should be self-evident.
#
# GNU parallel behaves like this: if you call it with --will-cite
# then it will print a bibtex item and touch
# `~/.parallel/will-cite`. On startup, GNU parallel omits the
# boilerplate if this file is present.
#
# Alternatively, one can disable the boilerplate via
# `--no-notice`.
#
# The `--no-notice` option is not documented but works (as-of
# version 20160222).
