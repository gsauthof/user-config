# xdg-open does more harm than it helps
#
# In many environments it calls a helper that yields a
# race-condition between viewer start and temporary file deletion:
#
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=653249
#
# A possible work-around is to use copiousoutput. The output
# isn't really copious but this delays the deletion until the
# user exits the pager
# application/pdf; /usr/bin/xdg-open %s ; copiousoutput
#
# Better approach, just eliminate the xdg-open call:
#
application/pdf; evince %s
application/x-pdf; evince %s

# pandoc is probably better maintained and more secure than:
#
#     elinks %s -dump -dump-color-mode 0 -dump-charset utf-8
#
# Links (`links %s -dump`) isn't really a good option as it
# doesn't include the href content of `<a>` elements.
#
text/html; pandoc -f html-native_divs-native_spans - -t markdown ; copiousoutput

# Use the 'eye-of-gnome' to view images
